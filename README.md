# :european_castle: :book: Elena: A Short Visual Novel

## What is Elena?

Elena is a short visual novel being developed for [‚õµShipwrecked](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/) that tells the story of the Kindgom of Carisia and their three princesses: Katherine, the oldest daughter, Theodora, the middle daughter, and you, Elena, the youngest daughter. Make choices (that don't *really* matter), read all that juicy text (or don't!), and find out what's truly going on in Carisia...

## What are *the features* of Elena?

‚≠ê Over 4+ endings!  
‚≠ê So! Much! Text!  
‚≠ê A fast-forward key if you don't like the text!  
‚≠ê Not-so-hidden lore!!  
‚≠ê A fast-forward key if you don't like the lore!    
‚≠ê Decisions that kind of matter!  
‚≠ê Decisions that *absolutely* do not matter!  
üåü And a true ending if you discover all other endings...  

## How did you make (and are you making) Elena?

Elena was originally developed as part of a "mobile game scam ad" jam. However I... took it a little farther and more serious that that. Most of Elena's code is built using Unity's custom structs, which makes creating a large amount of dialouge and connecting them all very breezey. It also uses a lot of IEnumerators[^1] to keep everything orderly and nice.

## When is it coming out?!?!?!

Sometime!! Next question.

###### Is there a demo or something?

No, not yet. I hope to finish this Soon<sup>TM</sup> so I will just ship the whole game instead. If you want to know when that happens uh... next question!

## What is *the story* of Elena?

Hey! No spoilers!!

###### Come onnnnn just a peak? Pleaseeeee?

Okay, fine, you get one screenshot, because you said please.

###### Yay!!!! ‚ô•
